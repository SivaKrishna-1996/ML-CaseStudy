## One of the most compelling stories of sports analytics made popular by the 2011 movie Moneyball, the Oakland Athletics team of 2002 created history by winning 20 consecutive games between August 13 and September 2002. Much of the Oakland Athletics (popularly referred to as the A’s) success in that season is attributed to their General Manager, Billy Beane and former Assistant General Manager, Paul DePodesta.

## DePodesta, a graduate in Economics from Harvard University joined the A’s in 1999 and quickly started incorporating analysis of baseball statistics to value and purchase players.
